#PING
These are the scripts and pipelines for calling KIR genotypes from NGS data; they form the components of PING (Pushing Immunogenetics to the Next Generation)

The scripts for harvesting KIR specific reads are here: 
They are for use with capture/enrichment runs
Or you can search through whole genome bams (best to narrow down by coordinates to unmapped and KIR-mapped regions first..)
