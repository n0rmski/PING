# PING
These are the scripts and pipelines for calling KIR genotypes from NGS data; they form the components of PING (Pushing Immunogenetics to the Next Generation)

Here are some very basic scripts for post PING processing -namely when you find new SNP alleles and want to validate them.

If you use any of these please cite:
