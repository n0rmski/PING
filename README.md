# PING
Here are sequences of alleles newly discovered using PING. These are all confirmed by re-amplification of source material. They are grouped by publication. The names will match those local names in the publication, but may since have been given official names by IPD. Once we have satisfied the IPD criteria (ie cloned/sequenced again, or found in homozygous) they are sent to them for allele names.
