New_alleles spreadsheet
These are alleles we identified by NGS, and have passed through at least one round of Sanger sequencing for confirmation but we haven't yet assigned a background allele to it.
If we can't assign a background allele fully, they will stay here until we or someone else finds a duplicate.
Feel free to edit file or email me if you find another copy of allele.
